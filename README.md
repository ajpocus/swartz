# swartz
Swartz is a simple forum-ish web app, inspired by Hacker News and Reddit. I wrote this app to become more familiar with Clojure, especially in the context of a web app. I also wrote this as an example, a sort of, "Hello world," for the web, so that others coming to Clojure from another language have an example to work from.

## Usage

You can start the swartz server by running `lein ring server` (or `lein run`) from the project directory.
